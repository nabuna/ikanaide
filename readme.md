long wip ahead

nothing here is final, I'm making this website to learn to code, so stuff that's not yet correct will probably be rewritten in the future

because of this, I don't really expect actual contributions to the repo; although, if you want to give me advice, I'd be very pleased to listen to you

if you wish to contact me, please make it through discord: nabuna#0001

this project is actually part of what I'll be presenting as the final project needed to finish up my studies, so code annotations will be done in spanish

it'll be online once I get the basic stuff ready (which, as of 230413, will be soon)
