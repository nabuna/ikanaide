    [X] Read PDO documentation from http://web.archive.org/web/20190330214051/http://wiki.hashphp.org/PDO_Tutorial_for_MySQL_Developers
            Noticed PDO works basically the same way as mysqli but is compatible with more drivers than mysql. Also, that OO mysqli is like an alias to procedural style.
            Result: I will use Object Oriended mysqli.
    [X] Understand how to call the conexion on multiples files (for example, through a global variable?).
            This can be investigated further, and it will be in the future. For now, I'll store credentials on a separate file and include it in .gitignore.
    [] Complete design constants in the css (e.g. styles for boxes, links, titles, highlighting...).
    [X] Complete `anime`, `manga` and `user` tables.

I would like to do something like Taiga for Ikanaide, though I feel like asking Taiga for Ikanaide implementation would be better at the start; taiga users could discover the website through the app.
If this ends up happening, I would never develop my own and instead promote theirs on the Ikanaide website.
